"""Morphir.SDK.Dict: a mapping from comparable keys to values.

This module follows elm/core 1.0.5. A `Dict[K, V]` is a frozen dataclass that
holds its entries as a tuple of `(key, value)` pairs, sorted in ascending order
by `basics.compare` on the key, with no key twice. Thus:

* `to_list`, `keys` and `values` yield the entries in key order, as in Elm.
* Two dicts with the same entries are equal (`==`) and have the same hash, no
  matter in which order the entries were inserted.
* Keys can be any comparable value: numbers, strings, and tuples or lists of
  comparables. A key that is not comparable raises `TypeError`.

Build a `Dict` with `empty`, `singleton`, `from_list` and `insert`. Do not pass
entries to the `Dict` constructor, because it does not sort them.

All functions take their arguments in Elm order, with the dict last, and yield
a new `Dict`; nothing is mutated. Lookup is a binary search, O(log n). `insert`
and `remove` copy the entries, O(n).

Some names in this module shadow Python built-ins (`filter`, `map`). Import the
module with an alias, not the names:

    >>> from morphir.sdk import dict as Dict
    >>> Dict.get("a", Dict.from_list((("b", 2), ("a", 1))))
    Just(value=1)
